# Surfer
Surfer is a browser without Internet by C++.Emmmm,alright,it can't visit the websites like GitHub.It was first released on AcWing in China.Sure,I'm the owner of Surfer.And Surfer is my first protect on GitHub.

If you can't run the codes,just delete all the Chinese words.If you deleted all the Chinese words but you also can't run the codes,just update you cpp APP.

You can change the codes and send it on other webs or GitHub.Don't say that you're the first editer of it.

Ver.3's file is Codes.

If you want to run Surfer version 3.0(Codes) with less memory, please copy and use C++ to run Surfer_Ver_4.

Some of the words in the things that Surfer output is kind of hard to know their meanings.If you don't know the meanings of this kind of words,you can ask me.
